# Decentraland Terraform Districts

This repository holds the proposals for community districts. Users will be able to contribute land parcels to these groups of shared interests at the Terraform event.

Those proposals that harness a lot of community interest early on will have the right to early placement on the map!

For more information about the process, see [our blog post](https://medium.com/p/acb777025218).

When submitting a District, please include its name, logo, and a 1-page description.
